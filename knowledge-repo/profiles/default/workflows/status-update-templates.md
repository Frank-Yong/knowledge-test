# Status Update Templates

Workplace-safe templates that are honest, calm, and copy/paste friendly.

## Initial update
We are investigating an issue affecting <who/what>. Current impact: <impact>. Next update by <time>.

## Mitigation in progress
We identified <suspected cause>. Mitigation: <what we are doing>. Current status: <improving/unchanged>. Next update by <time>.

## Resolved
The issue is resolved as of <time>. Root cause: <short>. Preventative actions: <bullets>. We will publish a post-incident summary by <date>.

## Internal note (slightly funny, still professional)
If you feel the urge to write “it’s fine”, replace it with one of:
- “No further impact observed for <duration>.”
- “Metrics have returned to baseline and remain stable.”
