# knowledge-repo/

## Purpose
This repository stores canonical team knowledge in a stable, discoverable folder structure.

## When to use
- When you need the source-of-truth for architecture, standards, workflows, or glossary terms
- When tooling needs stable paths to retrieve documents

## Canonical documents
1. profiles/default/README.md
2. profiles/default/architecture/system-overview.md
3. profiles/default/standards/naming-conventions.md

## Do/Don’t
- Do keep one concept per file
- Don’t rename published docs without coordinating with tooling and aliases
