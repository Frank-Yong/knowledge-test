# Polite Translations (Engineering Edition)

Short phrases that keep communication clear without being spicy.

- “Works on my machine” → “I haven’t reproduced it outside my environment yet.”
- “Quick fix” → “Small change; still needs review and verification.”
- “Probably fine” → “I don’t see evidence of risk, but we should monitor <signals>.”
- “It’s flaky” → “It fails intermittently; here are the last N failures and common traits.”
