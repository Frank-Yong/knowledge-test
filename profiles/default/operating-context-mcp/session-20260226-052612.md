# OperatingContextMcp Session Log

- Timestamp: 2026-02-26 05:26:12 (local)
- Source repo: operating-context-mcp
- Branch: phase-2-mcp-handshake
- Trigger: reviewer protocol comment + `log it`

## Change implemented

### `notifications/initialized` request-vs-notification handling
- File: `src/OperatingContextMcp.Server/Worker.cs`
- Updated method handling so `notifications/initialized` is ignored only when sent as a true notification (no `id`).
- When `notifications/initialized` includes an `id`, server now returns JSON-RPC error `-32600` (`Invalid Request`) instead of silently `continue`-ing.

## Why this matters
- Prevents clients from hanging while waiting for a response to an invalid request-form notification.
- Better aligns behavior with JSON-RPC/MCP expectations for request/notification semantics.

## Validation
- File diagnostics check for `Worker.cs`: no errors found.
- Command: `dotnet build src/OperatingContextMcp.sln`
- Result: succeeded.

## Status snapshot
- Addresses reviewer note on `notifications/initialized` handling with `id` present.
