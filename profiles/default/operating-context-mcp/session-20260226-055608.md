# OperatingContextMcp Session Log

- Timestamp: 2026-02-26 05:56:08 (local)
- Source repo: operating-context-mcp
- Branch: phase-2-mcp-handshake
- Trigger: reviewer notification-debugging comment + `log it`

## Change implemented

### Warning for unknown notification methods
- File: `src/OperatingContextMcp.Server/Worker.cs`
- In the no-`id` notification path, added warning log before ignore:
  - `logger.LogWarning("Ignoring unknown notification method {Method}.", method);`
- Existing behavior for valid `notifications/initialized` remains unchanged.

## Why this matters
- Keeps notification semantics intact (no response for notifications).
- Improves diagnostics for typos/misconfigured clients sending unexpected notification method names.

## Validation
- File diagnostics check for `Worker.cs`: no errors found.
- Command: `dotnet build src/OperatingContextMcp.sln`
- Result: succeeded.

## Status snapshot
- Addresses reviewer request for better observability when unknown notifications are ignored.
